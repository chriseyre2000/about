  The Elixir/Erlang philosophy is unless you can handle an error "let it crash".

  ```Donâ€™t code defensively - Joe Armstrong```
  (http://erlang.org/download/armstrong_thesis_2003.pdf)

  Adding error handling that you can't recover from for something
  unexpected will mask bugs. Let it crash, log the error and let a
  supervisor restart the process in a clean state.

  Elixir applications are usually constructed with supervisors:
