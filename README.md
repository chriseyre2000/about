# About

This library adds help documentation to iex.

This allows the user to have topics and reference materials in one place without having to know exactly which package to find it in. This project is at an early stage and would welcome contributions.

Once you have installed about then you can use:

iex> h About.regex

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `about` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:about, "~> 0.0.1"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/about](https://hexdocs.pm/about).
